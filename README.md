# Code for replicating ERA5 analysis for Stroeve et al., `Rain on Snow Understudied in Sea Ice Remote Sensing'

Analysis of the precipitation at Polarstern in September 2020 can be (and was) done locally on a machine. The data can be downloaded using download_ERA_ROS.ipynb, and then animated and analysed with Animate_ERA5_ROS_event.ipynb

Analysis of the annual ROS in the Central Arctic 1979-2020 must be done in the cloud unless you have a cluster etc. I did this with the Copernicus CDS toolbox: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home

The code required to perform the first part of the analysis with the toolbox can be found in ros_for_loop.py. The code runs in six-year chunks to avoid arrays that are too massive to handle. At the end of the analysis all the chunks are concatenated together for download.

The post-processing (masking out the CA, the spatial average and plotting the data) is done locally with Analyse_ERA5_trends.ipynb

To generate the figure in the supplement of the paper, the outputs of Analyse_ERA5_trends.ipynb and Animate_ERA5_ROS_event.ipynb are both saved as pickle files in the pickle directory.
The notebook make_combined_fig.ipynb reads these pickle files and makes the combined plot. 

cmaps.py generates the custom colorbar for the animation and the ptype axis for Figure S3 b.
